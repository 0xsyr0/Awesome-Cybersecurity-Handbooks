## Advanced Threat Analytics

- Traffic for DCs is mirrored to ATA Sensors (or installed on dc as service), activity profile is build
- Collects 4776 (credential validation of a user) to detect replay attacks, detects behavioral anomalies
- Detects: account enumeration, netsession enumeration, Brute Force, exposed cleartext credentials, honey tokens, unusual protocols, credential attacks (pth,ptt,ticket replay)
- Will NOT detect non existent users for golden ticket
- Detects DCSync, but not DCShadow

## API Security Tasks

Shoutout to `Tara Janca` from `We Hack Purple`!

1. List all APIs (create an inventory)
2. Put them behind a gateway
3. Throttling and resource quotas
4. Logging, monitoring and alerting
5. Block all unused HTTP methods
6. Use a service mesh for communication management
7. Implement standards for your organisation / API definition documents
8. Strict Linting
9. Authenticate THEN authorize
10. Avoid verbose error messages
11. Decommission old or unused versions of APIs
12. Do all the same secure coding practices you normally do; input validation using approved lists, parameterized queries, bounds checking, etc.

| 4729 | Member was removed from a global security group | A member got removed from a global security group which an attacker could do to clear indicators of compromise. | TA0005-Defense Evasion |
| 4732 | Member added to a security-enabled Local group | Monitors changes to local security groups, which could suggest unauthorized access or privilege escalation (e.g., an attacker adds a user to the "Administrators" local group) | T1098 - Account Manipulation |
| 4739 | Domain policy change | An attacker could use changes in domain policies for persistence. | TA0005-Defense Evasion |
| 4756 | Member added to a universal security group | High risk domain group membership change. | TA0003-Persistence |
| 4757 | A member was removed from a security-enabled universal group. | An attacker could try to remove his indicators of compromise or lock specific users out and distrupt access. | TA0005-Defense Evasion |
| 4768 | A Kerberos authentication ticket was requested (TGT Request) | Monitors initial authentication requests to track user logons, and helps identify potential abuse of the Kerberos protocol (e.g., an attacker compromises the NTLM hash of a privileged account and performs an overpass-the-hash attack which requests a TGT from an unusual host) | T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets |
| 4769 | A Kerberos service ticket was requested | Monitors for potential Kerberoasting attacks or other suspicious activities targeting the Kerberos protocol (e.g., a sudden increase in requests for unique services from a single user) | T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets |
| 4776 | The domain controller attempted to validate the credentials | Helps identify failed or successful attempts to validate credentials against the domain controller, which could indicate unauthorized access or suspicious authentication activity (e.g., an unusual number of failed validations from a single IP address) | T1110 - Brute Force |

| Event ID | Attack | Description |
| ---| --- | --- |
| 4662, 4738, 5136, 4769 | Set an SPN for the user and perform a kerberoast attack. | Setting a user's SPN results in a 4738, 4662 and 5136 for the target account. A subsequent 4769 captures the kerberoasting event. |
| 4662, 4738, 5136, 4768 | Disable pre-authentication and capture a user's TGT with an AS-REP roast attack. | Disabling pre-authentication results in a 4738 and 5136 for the target account. A subsequent 4768 captures the AS-REP roasting attack. |
| 4662, 5136, 4768 | Perform a shadow credential attack which sets the user object msDS-KeyCredentialLink property. | Setting mDS-KeyCredentialLink results in a 4662 and 5136 for the target account. A subsequent 4768 with pre-authentication type 16 and credential information is generated. |
| 4724, 4738 | Change the user's password | Changing a user's password results in a 4724 and 4738 for the target account. |

$keys = Get-ChildItem "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\"

foreach ($key in $keys)
{
    if (Test-Path ($key.pspath+"\Security"))
    {
        $sd = (Get-ItemProperty -Path ($key.pspath+"\Security") -Name "Security" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Security 
        if ($sd -eq $null)

        {
            Write-Host $key.PSChildName ' ' $sddl
        }
    }
}
```

## Device Guard

- Hardens against malware
- Run trusted code only, enforced in Kernel and Userspace (CCI, UMCI, KMCI)
- UEFI SEcure Boot protects bios and firmware

## General Configuration

- Limit login of DAs to DCs only
- Never run a service with DA privileges
- Check out temporary group memberships (Can have TTL)
- Disable account delegation for sensitive accounts (in ad usersettings)


## LAPS

Centralized password storage with periodic randomization, stored in computer objects in fields `mc-mcsAdmPwd` (cleartext), `ms-mcs-AdmPwdExperiationTime`.

## Layered Architecture

- Tier0: Domain Admins/Enterprise Admins
- Tier1: Significant Resource Access
- Tier2: Administrator for Workstations / Support etc.

## Mitigate Kerberoast

Use strong passwords and manage service accounts.

## Mitigate Skeleton Key

### Run lsass.exe as protected Process

```c
PC C:\> New-ItemProperty HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ -Name RunAsPPL -Value 1 -Verbose
```

### Check

```c
PC C:\> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Logname='System';ID=12} | ?{$_.message -like "*protected process*"}
```

## Mitigate Trust Attack

- Enable SID Filtering
- Enable Selective Authentication (access between forests not automated)

## Privileged Administrative Workstations

Use hardened workstation for performing sensitive task.

## Protected Users Group

- Cannot use CredSSP & Wdigest (no more cleartext creds)
- NTLM Hash not cached
- Kerberos does not use DES or RC4
- Requires at least server 2008, need to test impact, no offline sign-on (no caching), useless for computers and service accounts

## Red Forest

- ESAE Enhanced Security Admin Environment
- Dedicated administrative forest for managing critical assets (forests are security boundaries)

## Sniffing SSH Sessions

```c
$ strace -e trace=read -p <PID> 2>&1 | while read x; do echo "$x" | grep '^read.*= [1-9]$' | cut -f2 -d\"; done
```
