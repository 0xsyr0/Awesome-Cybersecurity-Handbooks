## Advanced Threat Analytics

- Traffic for DCs is mirrored to ATA Sensors (or installed on dc as service), activity profile is build
- Collects 4776 (credential validation of a user) to detect replay attacks, detects behavioral anomalies
- Detects: account enumeration, netsession enumeration, Brute Force, exposed cleartext credentials, honey tokens, unusual protocols, credential attacks (pth,ptt,ticket replay)
- Will NOT detect non existent users for golden ticket
- Detects DCSync, but not DCShadow

## Named Pipes

### Common Named Pipes

| Named Pipe | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \PIPE\svcctl | Service Control Manager (SCM) | Manages system services remotely, allowing control over starting, stopping, and configuring services. Attackers may use this to manipulate services for persistence or remote command execution. |
| \PIPE\samr | Security Account Manager (SAM) | Provides access to the SAM database, which stores user credentials. Often used by attackers to enumerate accounts or retrieve password hashes. |
| \PIPE\netlogon | Netlogon Service | Used for authentication and domain trust operations. Attackers can exploit it to perform pass-the-hash attacks or gain unauthorized domain access. |
| \PIPE\lsarpc | Local Security Authority Remote Procedure Call (LSARPC) | Grants access to security policies and account privileges. Attackers might use this pipe to gather information on security configurations and user privileges. |
| \PIPE\atsvc | AT Service / Task Scheduler | Facilitates remote task scheduling, often abused by attackers to execute commands on a remote system at specified times. Commonly used for persistence, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. |
| \PIPE\eventlog | Event Log Service | Manages event logging. Attackers may interact with this to clear or manipulate event logs to hide their tracks after malicious actions. |
| \PIPE\spoolss | Print Spooler Service | Manages print jobs. Historically vulnerable (e.g., PrintNightmare), making it a target for remote code execution and lateral movement. |
| \PIPE\wmi | Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) | Provides an interface for querying and managing system configurations. Attackers use WMI for remote system management, often for enumeration or remote command execution. |
| \PIPE\browser | Browser Service | Supports network browsing and domain controller location services. Attackers may use it to identify network hosts and domains. |
| \PIPE\msrpc | Microsoft RPC Endpoint Mapper | Acts as a gateway for RPC-based services. The pipe provides access to various RPC services, making it a high-value target for attackers to gain access to multiple functions. |

### Hexadecimal Notation

```console
5c:00:50:00:49:00:50:00:45
```

```console
5c:00: The Unicode encoding for the character \ (backslash).
50:00: The Unicode encoding for the character P.
49:00: The Unicode encoding for the character I.
50:00: The Unicode encoding for the character P.
45:00: The Unicode encoding for the character E.
